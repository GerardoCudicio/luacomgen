This is the beginning of a generator of Lua->COM bindings for regular COM interfaces (not IDispatch).

To run the tests, first edit Makefile.win and rectpoint/Makefile.win to reflect the paths for your
Windows Platform SDK and Lua installation. After that, run "nmake /f Makefile.win all" inside the
rectpoint directory, then run "nmake /f Makefile.win all" in the main directory.

Now open an administrator console, register rectpoint\rectpoint.dll with regsvr32 and run
"test_comgen.lua". If everything is ok there should be no output.

The Makefile assumes you have LuaRocks installed, along with the latest version of Cosmo (install
with "luarocks install cosmo current --from=http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks-cvs".

Types supported right now: longs, strings (normal, wide, tchar, bstr), I assume strings on the
Lua side are UTF-8 encoded, COM interfaces pointers created by the binding, enums, structs
(nesting should work, but is untested), SAFEARRAYs of these types, and most types of VARIANT,
including VARIANT SAFEARRAYs.

The goal is to add the whole menagerie of COM primitive types, along with support for reading type
libraries directly. It should be powerful enough to rewrite LuaCOM in pure Lua. :-)

The source is the documentation, for now. :-) The test_generate.lua and test_comgen.lua are a nice
overview of the API for generating a binding and using it, respectively,
